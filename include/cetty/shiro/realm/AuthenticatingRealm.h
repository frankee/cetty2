/**
 * A top-level abstract implementation of the <tt>Realm</tt> interface that only implements authentication support
 * (log-in) operations and leaves authorization (access control) behavior to subclasses.
 *
 * <p>Since a Realm provides both authentication <em>and</em> authorization operations, the implementation approach for
 * this class could have been reversed.  That is, authorization support could have been implemented here and
 * authentication support left to subclasses.
 *
 * <p>The reason the existing implementation is in place though
 * (authentication support) is that most authentication operations are fairly common across the large majority of
 * applications, whereas authorization operations are more so heavily dependent upon the application's data model, which
 * can vary widely.
 *
 * <p>By providing the most common authentication operations here and leaving data-model specific authorization checks
 * to subclasses, a top-level abstract class for most common authentication behavior is more useful as an extension
 * point for most applications.
